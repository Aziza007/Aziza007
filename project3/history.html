<h1>
About the Language </h1>
<p>
  Afaan Oromo, or “the Oromo language” has 40 million speakers in the world. Although it is the most widely spoken language in the Horn of Africa, many people do not know about it. That is because for many years, the language has been banned in Ethiopia, where many of its speakers are from. It was finally allowed to be taught in schools in 1991 after years of trying to destroy Oromo culture at the hands of the Ethiopian government. It is allowed to be taught and spoken, but still is not an official language of Ethiopia today.
Oromo speakers are from “Oromia” a region currently inside Ethiopia. For years Oromo people have hoped and fought for freedom. Many Oromo people do not consider themselves Ethiopian.
