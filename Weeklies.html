  <p>The Mechanism of Meaning: The Diagrammatic Genius of Arakawa and Gins:
	This piece was hard for me to understand, but what I got from it was that art is more scientific than people think. Arakawa said “if you want to become an artist, you have to become a scientist first.” which emphasizes that point that you can have a technical, scientific mind that is also creative. Making connections/a network was what I saw with the Lemon example. They made viewers see the lemon in different ways by making a diagram of categories. They form a network because they start off with just a lemon, and branch off to different kinds.</p>

<p>  Beyonce on IG: Beyonce usually posts her pictures on Instagram three at a time so it fits Instagram’s three post layout. Her posts are often selfies, pictures of her her family, and sometimes a slideshow like video. I love Beyonce not just for her music, but her ability to post pics of herself “and go.” The captions don’t do too much and she has a good social media presence where she shares enough to keep fans updated, but not oversharing her life.
 </p>
 <p> Fenty Beauty on IG: Fenty Beauty by Rihanna has taken off to be a large makeup company that emphasizes the need for makeup for all skin tones. Fenty Beauty’s marketing is very well done by combining professional shoots of the makeup, pictures from Fenty Beauty users (who vary in skin color), videos, and memes thrown in occasionally.</p>
  <h1>  Weekly 2 </h1>
  <p>Rand’s Objectivism is that human beings have to free ourselves from political and religious control. Once doing that, she believes humans would be “guided only by their selfish desires” meaning we only have ourselves. I see this relevant today because we have an individualistic culture in America. There’s the common saying of “picking yourself up by the bootstraps” and how no one should be given “handouts.” There are many people who live well off in this country and don’t care much about those who are suffering. They also may not realize if their own actions could be causing the suffering of other people and even if they did, they probably would not care.  </p>
  <h1>  Weekly 3 </h1>
  <p>Laura Owens at the Geffen:
A relationship between Owens’ art and technology that I saw was the interactive pieces. There were numbers written on the paintings that you could text with a question. I tried it, as well as other people who were in the room with me. It was kind of interesting, but I didn’t feel connected to technology with all of her pieces.
My favorite was the piece with the cats and newspaper sections added in. Her artwork seemed very fun and carefree which I read was her goal.

  <h1>  Weekly 4 </h1>
  <p>“The development of video technology will jeopardize the elitist position of traditional filmmakers and enable some sort of mass film production: an art of the people.” No one needs expensive equipment to be a filmmaker because most phones have a camera for videos and most computers have basic editing software. There are free editing sites online, and if they aren’t useful, the bigger name ones can be pirated.
	To be someone that wants to enjoy film is becoming easier as well. There are lots of sites, not including YouTube or Vimeo, that have full length films very quickly uploaded after their releases. This makes a lot of the popular films easy to access for almost anyone. Subscription sites like Netflix and Hulu continue to raise their prices, but for around $5-$10 a month, you have access to a wide variety of films from around the world.

  <h1>  Weekly 5 </h1>
  <p> Cybernetics is the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine. I do not believe humans can be understood through cybernetics. We are much more complex than machines and it seems weird to try to understand ourselves the same way them. We can’t compare something that humans make, to humans ourselves
</p>
  <h1>  Weekly 6 </h1>
  <p>The three systems Foucault says we are shaped through are surveillance, normalization, and examination. I believe that we are shaped through these systems, especially surveillance. Surveillance comes in with the Panopticon example. In our everyday lives, we are being surveilled. We are being watched through technology via social media posts and internet browsing history. We are being watched/listened to by our phones and other smart technology we have inside our homes. There are surveillance cameras around many businesses and neighborhoods, so it is as if we are always being watched.
	That physical surveillance works with the self-surveillance we do on ourselves. For example, to be a “good” student or person we will follow laws not because there is always someone watching us, but because we know that is what is expected of us. We follow the rules at our jobs and in the classroom because we know the consequences if we don’t. There doesn’t always have to be a physical surveillance item present, since we do it to ourselves. It is ingrained into our minds.
 </p>
  <h1>  Weekly 7 </h1>
  <p>“We are taught that corporations have a “soul” which is the most terrifying news in the world.” This is something I very much agree with and believe is scary. Many companies have a presence on twitter where they send tweets that are supposed to be seen as “funny” or “hip.” They post memes and argue with other companies through their Twitter profiles. This is dangerous because their image is transformed into a harmless, fun, company when they are not always that way. An example is fast food restaurants like Wendy’s and Burger King. Many times their tweets have gone around as fun, and it makes the companies look a lot less evil than they really are. In reality, these companies along with other fast food companies don’t even pay their employees well but are able to get past the bad image because of their quirky tweets.
Another way corporations try to make it seem like they have a soul is through their employees. I have worked several jobs where they try to make employees seem like they belong to the company “family” but they would not treat us as such. We are expected to follow harsh rules no matter what and can be fired and replaced quickly. That does not seem like a family at all.

  <h1>  Weekly 8 </h1>
  <p>The role of time and space is seen in his landscape and interior pieces. The background seems to go on forever with no indication of where it ends or what it is stopped by. Those pieces of his remind me of Dali’s paintings because of the spacing and the way the horizons go out to nothing. The empty spaces cause a feeling of mystery and intrigue, but also calmness. I can imagine myself in those spaces and the way they don’t have much in them is relaxing.  </p>
