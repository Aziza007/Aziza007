    <h1> She's on fire.</h1>
    <p> You have reached the end of this relationship. You, Zeus, reveal your
      full form to Semele causing her to burn up in flames. Your child inside of
      her is able to be saved by sewing him to your thigh until it's time for birth.
      That child is Dionysus, god of wine. Something (somewhat) good came from
      this affair! </p>
