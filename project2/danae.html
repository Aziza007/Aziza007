    <h1> Danae is a princess locked in a tower </h1>
<div style="background-color:black;">
    <p> Her father, King Acrisius, wanted a son, but the oracle told him he'd never have
      one. The oracle also told him that his daughter's son would kill him one day.
      Not wanting to risk an early death, he locked Danae up to keep her away from
      men and getting pregnant. There are guards at the tower, but you see her beauty and
      want her. What do you do? </p> </div>
