    <h1> Semele doesn't want to listen.</h1>
    <p> She wants to see your face for proof that you are actually Zeus, and
      not an eagle playing tricks on her. Seeing gods real forms can cause death
      among mortals, but you promised her you'd do anything for her. What do you
      choose to do? </p>
